# Stock Launch App

The app is a play on traditional finance that allows companies who want to sell stock in their company to do so in the form of an ERC20 token.  It allows an ERC20 to be deployed with the click of a button.  The following management features are available for the contract owner:  

- Screen to work with all available contract functions.
- Allow the contract owner to upload ETH to the contract and distribute it to their shareholders as a dividend based on the percentage of stock that they own.
- Allow the contract owner to create NFTs that can be claimed by their shareholders.


## Running the project locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
### `npm start`

The app has a dependency on running the following REST API to test all features: https://github.com/christian-reynolds/encode-bootcamp-team-project-rest
